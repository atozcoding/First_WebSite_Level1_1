    Click <a href="/html.html">HTML</a> to find out what it stands for.
    <p>I used a p tag here because I wanted a <a href="/block_element.html">block element</a>. Also, paragraph elements have a newline before and after them.

        <dt>I am usually a term that you want to define.</dt>
        <dd>And I am the description of that term.</dd>
        <dt>dt elements are block elements</dt>
        <dd>dd elements are block elements too.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Just remember that you should use <a href="/semantic_elements.html">semantic elements</a> when possible and that HTML is used to add structure to the content of a website, while CSS is used for styling. </p>
